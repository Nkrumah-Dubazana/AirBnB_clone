# HBNB - The Console (Version 2)

This repository hosts the second iteration of a student project aimed at developing a clone of the AirBnB website. This version enhances the backend interface, or console, to manage program data more effectively. With an emphasis on scalability and new features, it extends the foundational work of the original AirBnB_clone project. Console commands facilitate the creation, updating, and deletion of objects, alongside managing persistent file storage through improved JSON serialization/deserialization techniques.

## Updates in Version 2

- Enhanced object management and data serialization
- Improved persistent storage handling
- Additional classes and console commands for extended functionality
- Contributions to this version made by [Your Name] as part of [Context of Your Work]. The project continues to explore the realms of backend development with a focus on real-world application scenarios.
